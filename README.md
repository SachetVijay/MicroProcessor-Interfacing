# Learning Assembly Language for 8085 Microprocessor

## Description

This repository is dedicated to learning Assembly Language programming for the 8085 microprocessor. The 8085 microprocessor is an 8-bit microprocessor introduced by Intel in the mid-1970s. Assembly language programming for the 8085 involves writing low-level code that directly interacts with the microprocessor's instruction set architecture (ISA).

In this repository, you will find example code aimed at helping understand the fundamentals of Assembly Language programming for the 8085 microprocessor.

Assignments covered may include:

- Introduction to the 8085 microprocessor architecture
- Basics of Assembly Language programming
- Instruction set architecture (ISA) of the 8085 microprocessor
- Addressing modes and data movement instructions
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Control flow instructions
- Input/output (I/O) operations
- Writing and debugging Assembly Language programs for the 8085 microprocessor
